### **Phase 1 Execution Plan: Algorithm and Distribution System**

---

### **Objective**
The objective of Phase 1 is to develop the **Proof-of-Love algorithm** and **fund distribution system** for the BWen project. This phase will focus on creating a transparent and fair reward system that tracks contributions, calculates rewards, and distributes funds to DAO members via the Solana blockchain.

---

### **Scope**
This phase includes the following deliverables:
1. **Proof-of-Love Algorithm**: A system to track contributions and calculate rewards based on involvement levels.
2. **Distribution System**: A Solana smart contract and backend/frontend for automated fund distribution.
3. **Development Environment**: A fully configured environment with CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment.

---

### **Tasks and Timeline**

#### **1. Finalize Project Scope (1 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Conduct a meeting to finalize the features and functionalities of the Proof-of-Love algorithm and distribution system.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A clear list of features and deliverables.

#### **2. Set Up Development Environment (2 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Install and configure the following tools:
       - **Node.js** and **TypeScript** for backend development.
       - **Rust** and **Solana CLI** for smart contract development.
     - Set up **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A fully configured development environment.
     - Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

#### **3. Develop the Proof-of-Love Algorithm (7 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define how contributions will be tracked (e.g., GitHub commits, Discord activity).
     - Create a formula for calculating contribution points based on involvement levels (FULL-ON, INTERMEDIATE, RELAXED).
     - Implement the algorithm in the backend using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A functional Proof-of-Love algorithm.
     - Documentation for the algorithmâ€™s logic and formula.

#### **4. Build the Distribution System (7 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write and deploy a **Solana smart contract** in Rust to handle fund distribution.
     - Develop a backend to:
       - Fetch contribution data from APIs (e.g., GitHub, Discord).
       - Calculate rewards and trigger Solana transactions.
     - Create a **frontend interface** using **React.js** or **Next.js** for users to:
       - View their contribution points and rewards.
       - Dispute payments (if needed).
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A deployed Solana smart contract for fund distribution.
     - A functional backend and frontend for the distribution system.
     - Documentation for the smart contract and APIs.


### **Deliverables**
1. **Project Charter**: A document outlining the project scope and deliverables.
2. **Development Environment**: Fully configured tools and CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Proof-of-Love Algorithm**: A functional algorithm for tracking contributions and calculating rewards.
4. **Distribution System**: A Solana smart contract and backend/frontend for fund distribution.

### **Timeline**
| **Task**                     | **Time Required**
|-------------------------------|-------------------
| Finalize Project Scope        | 1 days           
| Set Up Development Environment| 2 days            
| Develop the Proof-of-Love Algorithm | 7 days     
| Build the Distribution System | 7 days           
| **Total**                     | **17 days**

### **Questions**
1. **Do we need to do this task on Eliza, or can we do it without Eliza?**
   - Can the Proof-of-Love algorithm and distribution system be developed independently of the Eliza AI agent?
   - If Eliza is required, what specific features or plugins should be utilized?

2. **How will the wallet have the funds to distribute?**
   - Will the Solana wallet be pre-funded with SOL tokens for distribution?


3. **How are contributions weighted?**
   - Should all contributions be treated equally?



---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Contributions**:
   - We are assuming that contributions primarily refer to **GitHub activity** (e.g., commits, pull requests, issues).


---

### **Next Steps**
Once Phase 1 is complete, the project will move to **Phase 2: 3D/AI Integration**, where the focus will shift to creating BWenâ€™s 3D avatar and integrating it with AI capabilities for metaverse and multimedia projects.
