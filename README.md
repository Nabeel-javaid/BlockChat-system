### **Phase 1 Execution Plan: Algorithm and Distribution System**

---

### **Objective**
The objective of Phase 1 is to develop the **Proof-of-Love algorithm** and **fund distribution system** for the BWen project. This phase will focus on creating a transparent and fair reward system that tracks contributions, calculates rewards, and distributes funds to DAO members via the Solana blockchain.

---

### **Scope**
This phase includes the following deliverables:
1. **Proof-of-Love Algorithm**: A system to track contributions and calculate rewards based on involvement levels.
2. **Distribution System**: A Solana smart contract and backend/frontend for automated fund distribution.
3. **Development Environment**: A fully configured environment with CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment.

---

### **Tasks and Timeline**

#### **1. Finalize Project Scope (2 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Conduct a stakeholder meeting to finalize the features and functionalities of the Proof-of-Love algorithm and distribution system.
     - Document the requirements in a **Project Charter**.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A clear list of features and deliverables.
     - A signed-off Project Charter.

#### **2. Set Up Development Environment (3 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Install and configure the following tools:
       - **Node.js** and **TypeScript** for backend development.
       - **Rust** and **Solana CLI** for smart contract development.
     - Set up **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A fully configured development environment.
     - Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

#### **3. Develop the Proof-of-Love Algorithm (5 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define how contributions will be tracked (e.g., GitHub commits, Discord activity).
     - Create a formula for calculating contribution points based on involvement levels (FULL-ON, INTERMEDIATE, RELAXED).
     - Implement the algorithm in the backend using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A functional Proof-of-Love algorithm.
     - Documentation for the algorithm’s logic and formula.

#### **4. Build the Distribution System (7 Days)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write and deploy a **Solana smart contract** in Rust to handle fund distribution.
     - Develop a backend to:
       - Fetch contribution data from APIs (e.g., GitHub, Discord).
       - Calculate rewards and trigger Solana transactions.
     - Create a **frontend interface** using **React.js** or **Next.js** for users to:
       - View their contribution points and rewards.
       - Dispute payments (if needed).
   - **Deliverables**:
     - A deployed Solana smart contract for fund distribution.
     - A functional backend and frontend for the distribution system.
     - Documentation for the smart contract and APIs.


### **Deliverables**
1. **Project Charter**: A document outlining the project scope and deliverables.
2. **Development Environment**: Fully configured tools and CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Proof-of-Love Algorithm**: A functional algorithm for tracking contributions and calculating rewards.
4. **Distribution System**: A Solana smart contract and backend/frontend for fund distribution.
